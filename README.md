```sql
SELECT constituency, party
FROM (SELECT constituency, party, 
      RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY constituency ORDER BY votes DESC) AS rank 
      FROM ge WHERE yr = '2017' 
      AND constituency BETWEEN 'S14000021' AND 'S14000026') AS ge_rank
WHERE rank = '1';
```
6. Show how many seats each party won in Scotland in 2017. (Scottish constituencies start with "S".)
```sql
SELECT party, COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT party, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY constituency ORDER BY votes DESC) AS rank 
      FROM ge 
      WHERE yr = '2017' 
      AND constituency LIKE 'S%') AS ge_rank
WHERE rank = '1'
GROUP BY party;
```

## 11. [Self JOIN](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Self_join)
<img src="images/buses_table.png" height = 250>

1. How many stops are in the database?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM stops;
```
2. Find the id value for the stop "Craiglockhart".
```sql
SELECT id 
FROM stops 
WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart';
```
3. Give the id and the name for the stops on the "4" "LRT" service.
```sql
SELECT id, name 
FROM stops, route
WHERE stops.id = route.stop
AND num = '4'
AND company = 'LRT';
```
4. The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes.
```sql
SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route 
WHERE stop = '149' OR stop = '53'
GROUP BY company, num
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2;
```
5. Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.
```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a 
JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
WHERE a.stop = '53' 
AND b.stop = '149';
```
6. The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. Change the query so that the services between Craiglockhart and London Road are shown.
```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a 
  JOIN route b ON (a.company = b.company AND a.num = b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop = stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop = stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart'
  AND stopb.name = 'London Road';
```
7. Give a list of all the services which connect stops 115 and 137 ("Haymarket" and "Leith").
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT R1.company, R1.num
FROM route R1, route R2
WHERE R1.num = R2.num 
  AND R1.company = R2.company
  AND R1.stop = '115' 
  AND R2.stop = '137';
```
8. Give a list of the services which connect the stops "Craiglockhart" and "Tollcross".
```sql
SELECT R1.company, R1.num
FROM route R1, route R2, stops S1, stops S2
WHERE R1.num = R2.num 
  AND R1.company = R2.company
  AND R1.stop = S1.id 
  AND R2.stop = S2.id
  AND S1.name = 'Craiglockhart'
  AND S2.name = 'Tollcross';
```
9. Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from "Craiglockhart" by taking one bus, including "Craiglockhart" itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT S2.name, R2.company, R2.num
FROM stops S1, stops S2, route R1, route R2
WHERE S1.name = 'Craiglockhart'
  AND S1.id = R1.stop
  AND R1.company = R2.company 
  AND R1.num = R2.num
  AND R2.stop = S2.id;
```
